Westron wynde when wyll thow blow,

 Chryst yf my love wer in my armes,
 and I yn my bed agayne,
With how sad steps, O Moone, thou climbst the skies,",
 How silent and with how wanne a face,,
What, it be that even in heavnly place",
 That busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?,
 Sure, if that long with Love aced eyes,
Can judge of Love, thou feelst a Lovers case;",
 I reade it in thy lookes, thy languisht grace,,
 To me that feele the like, thy state descries.,
Then evn of fellowO Moone, tell me",
Is constant Love deemd there but want of wit?",
 Are Beauties there as proud as here they be?,
Do they alove to be lovd, and yet",
 Those Lovers scorne whom that Love doth Possesse?,
 Do they call Vertue there unfulnesse?,
 Ah Sun-flowy of time,,
 Who countest the steps of the Sun,,
 Seekter that sweet goldclime,
 Where the travelney is done;,
 Where the Youth pined awith dere,,
 And the pale Vired in snow,,
 Atheir graves and are,,
 Where my Sun-flowes to go.,
 O Rose, thou art sick!,
 The iniworm,
 That flies in the night,
 In the howling storm,
 Has found out thy bed,
 Of crimson joy,,
 And his dark selove,
 Does thy life destroy.,
 Tyger! tyger! burning bright,
 In the forests of the night,,
 What imtal hand or eye,
 Could frame thy fearful symmetry?,
 In what distant deeps or skies,
 Burnt the fire of thine eyes?,
 On what wings dare he are?,
 What the hand dare seize the fire?,
 And what shoulder, & what art,,
 Could twist the sinews of thy heart?,
 And when thy heart beto beat,,
 What dread hand? & what dread feet?,
 What the hammer? the chain?,
 In what furnace was thy brain?,
 What the anvil? dread grasp,
 Dare its deadly terrors clasp?,
 When the stars threw down their spears,,
 And watered heaven with their tears,,
 Did he smile his work to see?,
 Did he who made the Lamb make thee?,
 Tyger! tyger! burning bright,
 In the forests of the night,,
 What imtal hand or eye,
 Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?,
 When a man hath no freedom to fight for at home,,
 Let him combat for that of his neighbours;,
 Let him think of the glories of Greece and of Rome,,
 And get knocked on the head for his labours,,
 To do good to manis the chivalplan,,
 And is always as nobly reed;,
 Then battle for freedom wherver you can,,
And if not shot or hanged youll get knighted.",
 My sweetest Lesbius live and love,,
 And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,,
 Let us not weigh them. great lamps do dive,
 Intheir west, and straight arevive,,
 But soon as once set is our little light,,
 Then must we sleep one ever-ing night.,
 If all would lead their lives in love like me,,
 Then bloody swords and armor should not be;,
 No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,,
 Unacame from the camp of love.,
 But fools do live and waste their little light,,
 And seek with pain their ever-ing night.,
 When timely death my life and fortune ends,,
 Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,,
 But let all lovers, rich in triumph, come,
 And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;,
 And Lesbiup thou my little light,,
 And crown with love my ever-ing night.,

 A stately pleasure dome decree:,
 Where Alph, the sacred river, ran,
 Through caverns measureto man,
 Down to a sunless sea.,
 So twice five miles of fertile ground,
 With walls and towers were girdled round:,
 And there were gardens bright with sinurills,,
 Where blossomed many an incense-ing tree;,
 And here were forests ancient as the hills,,
 Ening sunny spots of greenery.,
 But oh! that deep rotic chasm which slanted,
 Down the green hill aa cedarn cover!,
 A savage place! as holy and ened,
As eer bea waning moon was haunted",
 By woman wailing for her demon-er!,
 And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,,
 As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,,
 A mighty fountain momentwas forced:,
 Awhose swift half-terted burst,
 Huge fragments vaulted like reing hail,,
Or chaffy grain bethe threshers flail:",
And mid these dancing rocks, at once and ever",
 It flung up momentthe sacred river.,
 Five miles medera mazy motion,
 Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,,
 Then reached the caverns measureto man,,
 And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:,
And mid this tumult Kubla heard from far",
 Antral voices prophesing war!,
 The shadow of the dome of pleasure,
 Floated midway on the waves;,
 Where was heard the mingled measure,
 From the fountain and the caves.,
 It was a miraof rare device,,
 A sunny pleasure-with caves of ice!,
 A damsel with a dulcimer,
 In a vision once I saw:,
 It was an Abysimaid,,
 And on her dulcimshe played,,
 Singing of Mount Abora.,
 Could I rewithme,
 Her symphoand song,,
To such a deep detwould win me,",
 That with music loud and long,,
 I would build that dome in air,,
 That sunny dome! those caves of ice!,
 And all who heard should see them there,,
 And all should cry, BeBeware!,
 His flashing eyes! his floating hair!,
 Weave a circle round him thrice,,
 And close your eyes with holy dread,,
 For he on honey-hath fed,,
 And drunk the milk of Paradise.,

 From long to long in solemn sort.,

 Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,,

 No, I will go on farther--shall see.",
 The hard snow held me, save where now and then,
 One foot went through. The view was all in lines,
 Straight up and down of tall slim trees,

Now they are all on their knees,
 An elder said as we sat in a flock,
 By the embers in hearth side ease,
 We pictured the meek mild creatures where,
 They dwelt in their straw y pen,
 Nor did it octo one of us there,
 To doubt they were kneeling then.,
 So fair a fancy few would weave,
 In these years! I feel,,
 If someone said on Christmas Eve,
Come; the oxen kneel,
In the lonely barton by yonder coomb,

 Her hair was long, her foot was light,,
 And her eyes were wild.,
 I made a garland for her head,,
 And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;,
 She looked at me as she did love,,
 And made sweet moan.,
 I set her on my pacing steed,,
 And nothing else saw all day long,
 For sidelong would she bend, and sing,
A faerys song.",
 She found me roots of relish sweet,,
 And honey wild and manna-dew;,
 And sure in language strange she said,,
I love thee true.",
 She took me to her elfin grot,,
 And there she wept and sighed full sore;,
 And there I shut her wild, wild eyes,
 With kisses four.,
 And there she lulled me asleep,,
 And there I dreamed-- Ah! woe betide!--,
 The latest dream I ever dreamed,
On the cold hills side.",
 I saw pale kings and princes too,,
 Pale warripale were they all;,
 They cried,La Belle Dame sans Merci,
 Hath thee in thrall!",
 I saw their starved lips in the gloam,
 With horrid warning gaped wide,,
 And I aand found me here,
On the cold hills side.",
 And this is why I sojourn here,
 Aand palely loitering,,

 And no birds sing.,

 It sinks; and I am ready to depart.,

 But it must never, never come in sight;,
 I must stop short of thee the whole day long.,
 But when sleep comes to close each diffiday,,
 When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,,
 And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,,
 Must doff my will as raiment laid away--,

 And every fair from fair somedeclines,
By chance or natures changing course untrimmed",

Nor lose Possion of that fair thou owst",
Nor shall death brag thou wandrest in his shade",
When in enal lines to Time thou growst",
 So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,
 So long lives this, and this gives life to thee,

 I all abemy outcast state,

 Wishme like to one more rich in hope,
 Fealike him, like him with friends  possessed,
Deing this mans art and that mans scope",
 With what I most enconed least,
 Yet in these thoughts myaldespis,
 HapI think on thee--and then my state,
 Like to the lark at break of day aris,
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heavens gate",
 For thy sweet love rebered such wealth brings,
 That then I scorn to change my state with kings,
 That time of year thou mayst in me behold,
 When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang,
 Upthose boughs which shake athe cold,
 Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang,
 In me thou seest the twilight of such day,
 As after sunset fadeth in the west,
 Which by and by black night doth take away,
Deaths second self, that seals up all in rest",
 In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,
 That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
 As the deathwhereit must expire,
 Conwith that which it was nourished by,
 This thou perwhich makes thy love more strong,
 To love that well which thou must leave ere long,
 Thus with iined wing our swift scene flies,,
 In motion of no less cei,
 Than that of thought. Supthat you have seen,
 The well-aped king at Hampton pier,
 Emhis royaland his brave fleet,
 With silken streamers the young Phoebus fan,
 Play with your fancies, in them be,
 Upthe hempen tackle shipboys climb,
 Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give,
 To sounds conbethe threaden sails,,
 Borne with the iniand creeping wind,,
 Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,,
 Breastthe lofty surge. O, do but think,
 You stand upthe rivage and be,
 A city on the instant billows danc,
 For so apthis fleet maji,
 Holddue course to Harfleur. low, fol,
 Full fathom five thy father lies;,
 Of his bones are coral made;,
 Those are pearls that were his eyes:,
 Nothing of him that doth fade,,
 But doth suffer a sea change,
 Into something rich and strange.,

 The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,,
 Coning the last clouds of cold mority.,

 Far from the shore, far from the tremblthrong,

 The soul of Adois, a star,,
 Beafrom the awhere the Enal are.,

 With their love the breath between them;,
 And thy smiles before they dwindle,

 And this atsphere divinest,

 Fair are othnone beholds thee,,
 But thy voice sounds low and tender,
 Like the fairfor it folds thee,
 From the sight, liqsplendour,,
 And all feel, see thee never,,
 As I feel now, lost forever!,
 Lamp of Earth! er thou movest,
 Its dim shapes are clad with brightness,
 And the souls of whom thou lovest,
 Walk upon the winds with lightness,,
 Till they fail, I am failing,,
 Dizlost, yet unwailing!,
 The evering uniof things,
 Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,
 Now dark --now glitterreing gloom,
 Now lending splendour, from secret springs,
 The source of human thought its tribute brings,
 Of waters, -a sound but half its own,
 Such as a feeble brook will oft assume,
 In the wild woods, athe mountains lone,
 Where waterait leap for ev,
 Where woods and winds conand a vast riv,
 oits rocks ceasely bursts and raves,
 I met a travelan antique land,,
 Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone,
 Stand in the desert.... them, on the sand,,
 Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,,
 And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,,
 Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,
 Which yet surstamped on these lifeless things,,
 The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:,
 And on the pedesthese words appear:,
 My name is Ozydiof kings:,
 Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!,
 NothbereRound the decay,
 Of that cosal wreck, boundand bare,,
 The lone and level sands stretch far away.,
With how sad steps, O Moone, thou climbst the skies,",
 How silentand with how wanne a face,,
What, it be that even in heavnly place",
 That busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?,
 Sure, if that long with Love aced eyes,
Can judge of Love, thou feelst a Lovers case;",
 I reade it in thy lookes, thy languisht grace,,
 To me that feele the like, thy state descries.,
Then evn of fellowO Moone, tell me",
Is constant Love deemd there but want of wit?",
 Are Beauties there as proud as here they be?,
Do they alove to be lovd, and yet",
 Those Lovers scorne whom that Love doth Possesse?,
 Do they call Vertue there unfulnesse?,
 Who travels by the wearie wandring way,,
 To come vnhis wished home in haste,,
 And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,,
 Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,,
 Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?,
 Most enuithat grieues at neighbours good,,
 And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,,
 Why wilt not let him pass, that long hath stood,
 Vthe banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?,
 He there does now enenall rest,
 And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,,
 And further from it daily wanderest:,
 What if some little paine the passage haue,,
 That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?,
 Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,,
 And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?,
 Sleepe after toyle, port after stormy seas,,
 Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.,
 A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,,
 With craft of deand with cunning of sound unsought,,
 That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear,
 A roundel is wrought.,
 Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught--,
 Love, laughter, or mourning--brance of rapture or fear--,
 That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.,
As a birds quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear",
 Pause answer to pause, and athe same strain caught,,
 So moves the dewhence, as a pearl or tear,,
 A roundel is wrought.,
 Long lines of cliff breakhave left a chas,
 And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;,
 Bered roofs aa narrow wharf,
 In cluster; a mouldered church; and high,
 A long street climbs to one tall-ered mill;,
 And high in heaven beit a gray down,
 With Danish barrows; a hazel,
 By autumn nutters haunted, flourish,
 Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.,
 Dark house, by which once more I stand,
 Here in the long unly street,,
 Doors, my heart was used to beat,
 So quickly, waiting for a hand,,
 A hand that can be clasped no more-,
 Beme, I cannot sleep,,
 And like a guilty thing I creep,
 At earliing to the door.,
 He is not here; but far away,
 The noise of life bea gain,,
 And ghastly through the drizzling rain,
 On the bald street breaks the blank day.,
 He ended: thur knew the voice; the face,
 Well was helmet-den, the name,
 Went wanderwhere darkling in his mind.,
 And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,,
 But let the drunkard, he stretched from horse,
 To strike him, veranchis bulk,,
 Down from the causeway heavithe swamp,
 Fall, the crest of some slow-ing wave,,
 Heard in dead night athat table-,
 Drops flat, and after the great waters break,
 Whiting for half a league, and thin them,
 Far over sands marwith moon and cloud,,
 From less and less to nothing; he fell,
 Head-y; the knights, who watched him, roared,
 And shouted and leapt down upthe fall,
 There trampled out his face from being known,,
 And sank his head in mire, and slimed them,
 Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang,
 Through open doors, and swording right and left,
 Men, women, on their sodden faces,,
 The tables over and the wines, and slew,
 Till all the rafters rang with woman-,
 And all the pavement streamed with massa,
 He clasps the crag with crooked hands;,
 Close to the sun in lonely lands,,
 Ringed with the azure world, he stands.,
 The wrinkled sea behim crawls;,
 He watches from his mountain walls,,
 And like a thunderhe falls.,
 Bethe thunders of the upper deep,,
 Far, far bein the amal sea,,
 His ancient, dreamless, unvasleep,
 The Kraken sleepeth: est sunlights flee,
 Ahis shadowahim swell,
 Huge sponges of milniand height;,
 And far ainthe sickly light,,
 From many a wondrous grot and secret cell,
 Unbered and emous polypi,
 Winwith giant arms the slumbergreen.,
 There hath he lain for ages and will lie,
 Bating uphuge seaworms in his sleep,
