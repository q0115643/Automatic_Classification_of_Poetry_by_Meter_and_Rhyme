Fea tured like him like him with friends pos sessed,+--+-+-+-+
Did he smile his work to see?,+-+-+-+
I can re mem ber when he was a pup.,+--+--+--+
And saw from elm tops del i cate as flow er of grass,-+-+-+---+--+
The word the cuck oo cries to his mate,-+-+-+--+
The night is freez ing fast,-+-+-+
No run ner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.,-+-+-+-+++-
And all is seared with trade bleared smeared with toil,-+-+-+++-+
As spong es buck ets do,-+-+-+
Runs di verse wan d'ring man y a fa mous Realm,+-++-+--+-+
Nor heard the King for their own cries but sprang,-+-+--++-+
Vaunt cou riers of oak cleav ing thun der bolts,++--++-+-+
Come see the ox en kneel,+--+-+
As two in whom they were proved mis tak en,-+-+--+-+-
They cried La Belle Dame sans Mer ci,-+-+-+-+
Think true love act ed sim ple mod es ty.,++++-+-+-+
They ne ver say a word to her,-+-+-+-+
A mid a place of stone,-+-+-+
The source of hu man thought its trib ute brings,-+-+-+-+-+
Come night come Ro me o come thou day in night,++++--+-+-+
Or what is the mat ter.,-+--+-
From death to life thou mightst him yet re cov er .,-+-+-+-+-+^
In what dis tant deeps or skies,+-+-+-+
In roar ing he shall rise and on the sur face die.,-+-+-+-+-+-+
To still my beat ing mind.,-+-+-+
Yet come to me in dreams that I may live,-+-+-+-+-+
And if not shot or hanged you'll get knight ed.,--+--+--+-
Far o ver sands mar bled with moon and cloud,+--++--+-+
On the cold hill's side.,--+++
But oh! that deep ro man tic chasm which slant ed,-+-+-+-+-+-
The shrill de ment ed cho irs of wail ing shells,-+-+-+--+-+
And then there was a pile of wood for which,-+-+-+-+-+
My God and love Thee so.,-+-+-+
Of pure ab lu tion round earth's hu man shores,-+-+-+++-+
Bear his mild yoke they serve him best. His state,+-+++--+-+
Since there's no help come let us kiss and part,-+-++--+-+
The ev er last ing u ni verse of things,-+-+-+-+-+
To mor row comes De cem ber,-+-+-+^

Di vorce me un tie or break that knot a gain,-+--+-+++-+
From man y a won drous grot and se cret cell,-+--+-+-+-+
Or e ven last year's or the year's be fore.,-+-++--+-+
His flash ing eyes! his float ing hair!,-+-+-+-+
Ei ther man's work or his own gifts who best,+-++--++-+
He took his vor pal sword in hand,-+-+-+-+
Then a mile of warm sea scent ed beach,--+-++--+
Shoul der ing the na ked crag oh at that time,+---+-++-++
That run a ways' eyes may wink and Ro me o,-+--+-+-+-+
Not in the hands of boys but in their eyes,+--+-+-+-+
Yet dear ly I love you and would be lov d fain,-+--+--+-+-+
In the lone ly bar ton by yon der coomb,--+-+--+-+
With the hot blood of youth of love crossed long a go,--++-+-+++-+
So quick ly wait ing for a hand,++-+---+
O what can ail thee knight at arms,-+-+-+-+
For side long would she bend and sing,-+-+-+-+
Yet she has fan cied black birds hide,-+-+-+-+
He clasps the crag with crook ed hands,-+-+-+-+
And this at mo sphere div in est,+-+-+-+-
By sin in it which it towards hell doth weigh.,-+-+-+-+-+
Shall shine the ho ly glim mers of good byes.,-+-+-+-+-+
Shake hands for ev er can cel all our vows,++-+-+-+-+
Bea cons from the a bode where the E ter nal are.,+-+--++--+-+
Where blos somed man y an in cense bear ing tree,-+-+--+-+-+
When his pulse fail ing Pas sion speech less lies,+-++-+-+-+
Our child hood used to know,-+-+-+
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,-+-+-+-+-+
But am be trothed un to your en e my.,-+-++--+-+
And when we meet at an y time a gain,-+-+-+-+-+
But soon as once set is our lit tle light,-+-++-++-+
With walls and towers were gir dled round,-+-+-+-+
Leave not a rack be hind. We are such stuff,+--+-++--+
Ringed with the az ure world he stands.,+--+-+-+
For Heft them Pound for Pound,-+-+-+
A roun del is wrought.,-+--+
Un til the lat ter fi re shall heat the deep,-+-+-++-+-+
Christ mas Eve and twelve of the clock.,+-+-+--+
And like a guil ty thing I creep,-+-+-+-+
It will flame out like shin ing from shook foil,--++-+--++
If all would lead their lives in love like me,-+-+-+-+-+
Then reached the cav erns meas ure less to man,-+-+-+-+-+
And wears the turn ing globe.,-+-+-+
And wa tered heav en with their tears,-+-+-+-+
On ly the stut ter ing ri fles' ra pid rat tle,+--+--+-+-+-
Went wan der ing some where dark ling in his mind.,-+--+-+-+-+
Sure if that long with Love ac quaint ed eyes,+--+-+-+-+
Con fu sion of the death bed o ver is it sent,-+---+++-+-+
It was no dream of the gift of i dle hou rs,--++--+-+-+-
Of snow up on the moun tains and the moors,-+-+-+-+-+
Ever y thing said as per son al to him self.,+--+-+--+-+
But is cap tived and proves weak or un true.,-++--++--+
Pleased if some souls for such there needs must be,+-++-+-+-+
With rocks and stones and trees.,-+-+-+
And get knocked on the head for his la bours,--+--+--+-
Is king ly. Thou sands at his bid ding speed,-+-+-+-+-+
A sav age place! as ho ly and en chant ed,-+-+-+-+-+-
Be sec ret and ex ult,-+-+-+
A hand that can be clasped no more,-+---+++
The lone and lev el sands stretch far a way.,-+-+-+++-+
And I have asked to be,-+-+-+
To the ear nest love that laid the swale in rows,--+-+-+-+-+
Hood my un manned blood bat ing in my cheeks,+--+++---+
And though the sag er sort our deeds re prove,-+-+-+-+-+
But when sleep comes to close each dif fi cult day,--++-+++--+
Thus with i mag ined wing our swift scene flies,+--+-+-+++
Which I de sired and got 'twas but a dream of thee.,-+-+-++--+-+
The Kra ken sleep eth fain test sun lights flee,-+-+-+-+-+
And sud den ar bors shad ow coarse spun lines?,-+-+-+-+++
I run to death and death meets me as fast,-+-+-+++-+
Be it not seen in ei ther of our brows,--++-+-+-+
Or to o ur end like way may have,-+--+++-+
Float ed mid way on the waves,+-+-+-+
The old dog barks back wards with out get ting up.,-++++--+--+
