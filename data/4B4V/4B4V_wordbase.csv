And there repose. A turn or two I'll walk,-+-+-+-+-+
"She dwelt a mong the untrodden ways,",-+-+--+-+
"And sleep, and wake, yet never break the chain?",-+-+-+-+-+
I            can re member             when he was a pup.,+--+--+--+
She seemed a thing that could not feel,-+-+-+-+
Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.,+--+-+-+-+
In a vision once I saw:,--+-+-+
"Let not my hearse be vexed with mourning friends,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Out naked on the roads, as the books say, and stricken",++---+--++-+-
"Enwrought with golden and silver light,",-+-+--+-+
By woman wailing for her demon-lover!,-+-+-+-+-+-
What was it it whispered? I knew not well myself;,-+--+--+-+-+
And post o'er land and ocean without rest:,-+-+-+--++
What the anvil? what dread grasp,+-+-+++
"It gathers to a greatness, like the ooze of oil",-+---+-+-+-+
"The squirrel's granary is full,",-+-+-+-+
"Or free his feet, that in the myre sticke fast?",-+-+-+-+++
Huge sponges ofmillennial growth and height;,++---+--+-+
"Then battle for freedom wherever you can,",-+--+--+--+
And not blush so to be admired.,-+++-+-+-
"Then once by man and angels to be seen,",++-+-+---+
"In truth the prison, unto which we doom",-+-+-+-+-+
And pay no worship to the garish sun.,-+++---+-+
That are so wondrous sweet and fair!,--++-+-+
"Extremes to touch, and mean one thing.",-+-+-+++
Alone and palely loitering?,-+-+-+-+
Not in lone splendour hung aloft the night,+-++-+-+-+
And the pile somewhat sunken. Clematis,--++-+-+-+
"Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled",++---+-+-+
"All mimsy were the borogoves,",++-+-+-+
That Benediction which the eclipsing curse,-+-+-+--+-+
"That bellies and drags in the wind,",-+--+--+
"I all alone beweep my outcast state,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Walk upon the winds with lightness,",+-+-+-+-
Ever to come up with Dactyl trisyllable.,+--+--+--+--
It flung up momently the sacred river.,-+++---+-+-
"Our revels now are ended. These our actors,",-+-+-+-+-+-
Consuming the last clouds of cold mortality.,-+--++-+-+-+
"Where springs not fail,",-+++
"Where can we find two better hemispheres,",+--+++-+-+
An elder said as we sat in a flock,-+-+--+--+
"Through wood and dale the sacred river ran,",-+-+-+-+-+
"High as the highest peak of Furness fells,",+--+-+-+-+
"""I love thee true.""",-+-+
And that one talent which is death to hide,-+++---+-+
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,-+-+-+-+-+
Are with me from the past;,-+-+-+
"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,",+--+-+--+-+
"'Twas so; but this, all pleasures fancies be.",-+-+++-+-+
"Repair me now, for now mine end doth haste;",-+-+-+-+-+
"Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,",++-+---+-+
"Of waters,--with a sound but half its own,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Has woven a winter robe,",-+--+-+
Tyger! tyger! burning bright,+-+-+-+
"That we sit sometimes in the wayside nook,",--+-+--+-+
"I set her on my pacing steed,",-+-+-+-+
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",-+-+-+-+-+
Into something rich and strange.,+-+-+-+
Lamp of Earth! where'er thou movest,+-+-+-+-
"Fair are others; none beholds thee,",+-+-+-+-
"I reade it in thy lookes, thy languisht grace,",-+-+-+-+-+
Trochee trips from long to short.,+-+-+-+
Thy glory by Thy side.,-+-+-+
"By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,",--++-+-+-+
"From the sight, that liquid splendour,",+-+-+-+-
And is always as nobly requited;,--+--+--+-
Then must we sleep one ever-during night.,+--+++-+-+
And his dark secret love,--++-+
"She laughs at them for childishness,",-+-+-+-+
At earliest morning to the door.,-+--+-+-+
"I strove with none, for none was worth my strife:",-+-+-+-+-+
"And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,",-+-+-+-+-+
And drunk the milk of Paradise.,-+-+-+-+
"Where the Youth pined away with desire,",--+--+--+-
"To serve therewith my Maker, and present",-+-+-+-+-+
"And every fair from fair sometimes declines,",-+-+-++--+
The one the other will absorb--,-+-+-+-+
Those are pearls that were his eyes:,+-+-+-+
That all the world will be in love with night,-+-+-+-+-+
"I, like an usurped town, to another due,",+---++--+-+
The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls;,-+-+-+-+
"Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,",++-+-+-+-+
"The frumious Bandersnatch!""",-+--+-+
"I met a lady in the meads,",-+-+-+-+
A stately pleasure dome decree:,-+-+-+-+
That busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?,-+-+--++-+
"But it must never, never come in sight;",-+-+-+-+-+
The Brain is deeper than the sea--,-+-+-+-+
Be it not seen in either of our brows,--++-+-+-+
I had no human fears:,--++-+
As Phaeton would whip you to the west,-+-+-+-+-+
I envy no man's nightingale or spring;,-+-+-+-+-+
We pictured the meek mild creatures where,-+--+++-+
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?,-+-+-+-+
With equanimity.,-+-+-+
"Take him and cut him out in little stars,",+--+-+-+-+
That makes ingrateful man.,-+-+-+
"Must all be veiled, while he that reads, divines,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Generations have trod, have trod, have trod;",+-+--+-+-+
Forest on forest hung above his head,+--+-+-+-+
How Dick would hate the cold.,-+-+-+
Come in the speaking silence of a dream;,+--+-+-+-+
The fact is the sweetest dream that labor knows.,-+--+-+-+-+
To warm the frozen swamp as best it could,-+-+-+-+-+
"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,",-+-+-+-+
"To come vnto his wished home in haste,",-++--+-+-+
Could so forget his handiwork on which,-+-+-+-+-+
"""And hast thou slain the Jabberwock?",-+-+-+-+
"He left it dead, and with its head",-+-+-+-+
"Who plainly say, My God, My King.",-+-+-+-+
"Not to a true, but painted chair?",+--+-+-+
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:,--++--++-+
And out of the swing of the sea.,-+--+--+
"Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold;",++-+-+-+
So Love's inflamèd shaft or brand,-+-+-+-+
As those move easiest who have learn'd to dance.,-+++--+-+-+
"And Innocence is closing up his eyes,",-+-+-+-+-+
And the woman calling.,+-+-+-
"Then ev'n of fellowship, O Moone, tell me",-+-+-+-+++
Despair behind and death before doth cast,-+-+-+-+-+
Tyger! tyger! burning bright,+-+-+-+
"Featured like him, like him with friends possessed,",+--+-+-+-+
Did he smile his work to see?,+-+-+-+
I            can re member             when he was a pup.,+--+--+--+
"And saw from elm-tops, delicate as flower of grass,",-+-+-+---+--+
The word the cuckoo cries to his mate,-+-+-+--+
"The night is freezing fast,",-+-+-+
No runner tracks in this year's snow looped near it.,-+-+-+-+++-
"And all is seared with trade; bleared, smeared with toil;",-+-+-+++-+
As sponges-- buckets-- do--,-+-+-+
"Runs diverse, wand'ring many a famous Realm",+-++-+--+-+
"Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang",-+-+--++-+
"Vaunt-couriers of oak-cleaving thunderbolts,",++--++-+-+
"""Come; see the oxen kneel",+--+-+
"As two in whom they were proved mistaken,",-+-+--+-+-
"They cried, ""La Belle Dame sans Merci",-+-+-+-+
Think true love acted simple modesty.,++++-+-+-+
They never say a word to her,-+-+-+-+
"Amid a place of stone,",-+-+-+
The source of human thought its tribute brings,-+-+-+-+-+
"Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;",++++--+-+-+
Or what is the matter.,-+--+-
From death to life thou mightst him yet recover.,-+-+-+-+-+^
In what distant deeps or skies,+-+-+-+
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.,-+-+-+-+-+-+
To still my beating mind.,-+-+-+
"Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live",-+-+-+-+-+
And if not shot or hanged you'll get knighted.,--+--+--+-
"Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,",+--++--+-+
On the cold hill's side.,--+++
But oh! that deep romantic chasm which slanted,-+-+-+-+-+-
"The shrill, demented choirs of wailing shells;",-+-+-+--+-+
And then there was a pile of wood for which,-+-+-+-+-+
My God and love Thee so.,-+-+-+
"Of pure ablution round earth's human shores,",-+-+-+++-+
"Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state",+-+++--+-+
"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part;",-+-++--+-+
The everlasting universe of things,-+-+-+-+-+
To-morrow comes December;,-+-+-+^
"Suffer herself to be desired,",+--+-+-+-
May read in thee;,-+-+
"Divorce me, untie or break that knot again;",-+--+-+++-+
From many a wondrous grotand secret cell,-+--+-+-+-+
Or even last year's or the year's before.,-+-++--+-+
His flashing eyes! his floating hair!,-+-+-+-+
Either man's work or his own gifts: who best,+-++--++-+
He took his vorpal sword in hand:,-+-+-+-+
Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;,--+-++--+
"Shouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time",+---+-++-++
"That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo",-+--+-+-+-+
Not in the hands of boys but in their eyes,+--+-+-+-+
"Yet dearly I love you, and would be lovèd fain,",-+--+--+-+-+
"""In the lonely barton by yonder coomb",--+-+--+-+
"With the hot blood of youth, of love crossed long ago;",--++-+-+++-+
"So quickly, waiting for a hand,",++-+---+ 
"O what can ail thee, knight-at-arms,",-+-+-+-+
"For sidelong would she bend, and sing",-+-+-+-+
Yet she has fancied blackbirds hide,-+-+-+-+
He clasps the crag with crooked hands;,-+-+-+-+
And this atmosphere divinest,+-+-+-+-
"By sin in it, which it towards hell doth weigh.",-+-+-+-+-+
Shall shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes.,-+-+-+-+-+
"Shake hands forever,  can cel all our vows,",++-+-+-+-+
Beacons from the abode where the Eternal are.,+-+--++--+-+
Where blossomed many an incense-bearing tree;,-+-+--+-+-+
"When, his pulse failing, Passion speechless lies,",+-++-+-+-+
"Our childhood used to know,""",-+-+-+
That then I scorn to change my state with kings.,-+-+-+-+-+
But am betrothed unto your enemy.,-+-++--+-+
"And when we meet at any time again,",-+-+-+-+-+
"But soon as once set is our little light,",-+-++-++-+
With walls and towers were girdled round:,-+-+-+-+
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff,+--+-++--+
"Ringed with the azure world, he stands.",+--+-+-+
For-- Heft them-- Pound for Pound--,-+-+-+
A roundel is wrought.,-+--+
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;,-+-+-++-+-+
"Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.",+-+-+--+
And like a guilty thing I creep,-+-+-+-+
"It will flame out, like shining from shook foil;",--++-+--++
"If all would lead their lives in love like me,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Then reached the caverns measureless to man,",-+-+-+-+-+
And wears the turning globe.,-+-+-+
"And watered heaven with their tears,",-+-+-+-+
Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle,+--+--+-+-+-
Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.,-+--+-+-+-+
"Sure, if that long with Love acquainted eyes",+--+-+-+-+
"Confusion of the death-bed over, is it sent",-+---+++-+-+
"It was no dream of the gift of idle hours,",--++--+-+-+-
Of snow upon the mountains and the moors--,-+-+-+-+-+
Everything said as personal to himself.,+--+-+--+-+
"But is captived, and proves weak or untrue.",-++--++--+
Pleased if some souls (for such there needs must be),+-++-+-+-+
With rocks and stones and trees.,-+-+-+
"And get knocked on the head for his labours,",--+--+--+-
Is kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed,-+-+-+-+-+
A savage place! as holy and enchanted,-+-+-+-+-+-
"Be secret and exult,",-+-+-+
A hand that can be clasped no more-,-+---+++ 
The lone and level sands stretch far away.,-+-+-+++-+
And I have asked to be,-+-+-+
"To the earnest love that laid the swale in rows,",--+-+-+-+-+
"Hood my unmanned blood, bating in my cheeks,",+--+++---+
"And though the sager sort our deeds reprove,",-+-+-+-+-+
"But when sleep comes to close each difficult day,",--++-+++--+
"Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies,",+--+-+-+++
"Which I desired, and got, 'twas but a dream of thee.",-+-+-++--+-+
The Kraken sleepeth:  faintest sunlights flee,-+-+-+-+-+
And sudden arbors shadow coarse-spun lines?,-+-+-+-+++
"I run to death, and death meets me as fast,",-+-+-+++-+
Be it not seen in either of our brows,--++-+-+-+
Or to our end like way may have,-+--+++-+
Floated midway on the waves;,+-+-+-+
The old dog barks backwards with out get ting up.,-++++--+--+
What the hand dare seize the fire?,+-+++-+-
"Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then,",+--+--+--+--
"And as in uffish thought he stood,",-+-+-+-+
Tell her that wastes her time and me,++-+-+-+
"Oh, just beyond the sweetest thoughts that throng",++-+-+-+-+
And thereupon imagination and heart were driven,-+-+-+-+--+-+-
Leap to these arms untalked of and unseen.,+--+-+-+-+
"Either what Death or Love is well,",+--+-+-+
"I dare not move my dim eyes any way,",-+++-+++-+
Not so much life as on a summer's day,-+-+-+-+-+
"As dreams are made on, and our little life",-+-+-+-+-+
"Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;",++++--+-+-+
"To put a tree between us when he lighted,",-+-+-+-+-+-
"Sleepe after toyle, port after stormy seas,",+--++--+-+
Had in high places built her lodge; though mean,--++-+-+-+
Shrouds thee wheresoe'er thou shinest.,+-+-+-+-
"Though the sedge is withered from the lake,",--+-+-+-+
Seeking after that sweet golden clime,--+--+--+
"Arise from their graves and aspire,",-+--+--+-
"In these years! Yet, I feel,",-+-+-+
"Still, still to hear her tender-taken breath,",++-+-+-+-+
"Prompt hand and headpiece clever,",++-+-+-
Where I may sit and see,-+-+-+
"Draw the huge bottoms through the furrowed sea,",+-++-+-+-+
"Vanished, and left but memories, that should be out of season",+--+-+---+-+-+-
"In fiery ringlets from their sleep,",-+--+-+-+
"There was never a sound beside the wood but one,",--+--+-+-+-+
"And look upon myself, and curse my fate,",-+-+-+-+-+
"But ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)",-+-+-++--+
He went behind it to make his last stand.,-+-+--+-++
And on thy cheeks a fading rose,-+-+-+-+
"That now she knows,",-+-+
Five miles meandering with a mazy motion,++-+--+-+-+-
To fields where flies no sharp and sided hail,-+-+-+-+-+
And there she wept and sighed full sore;,-+-+-+++
"By a flash of lightning, or a wave;",--+-+-+-+
Anything more than the truth would have seemed too weak,+--+--+--+-+
Nor did it occur to one of us there,-+--+-+--+
Who was so foolish as to think what he thought.,--++-+-+-+-
And with sweet pastimes grace my happy tomb;,--++-+-+-+
She cries at them for carelessness,-+-+-+-+
And shakes this fragile frame at eve,-+-+-+-+
"Take him and cut him out in little stars,",+--+-+-+-+
"The Line too labours, and the Words move slow;",-+++---+++
Then die! that she,++-+
"By man and beast and earth and air and sea,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Reason, your viceroy in me, me should defend,",+--+--++--+
In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.,-+-+-+-+-+-+
In motion of no less celerity,-+--++-+-+
"Until I cried and trembled and rocked to and fro,",-+-+-+--++-+
And honey wild and manna-dew;,-+-+-+-+
And though the last lights off the black West went,-+-++--+++
"Out walking in the frozen swamp one gray day,",-+---+-+--+
Think true love acted simple modesty.,++++-+-+-+
"And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:",-+-+-+-+-+
Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.,++--+-+--+
"Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve,",++-+-+---+
"Bring the balloon of the mind,",+--+--+
And the harvest's done.,--+-+
And leave it there far from a useful fireplace,-+-++--+-+--
With mazy error under pendant shades,-+-+-+-+-+
"And all who heard should see them there,",-+-+-+-+
"Next, when I cast mine eyes and see",+--+-+-+
That had'st thou sprung,-+-+
"What if some little paine the passage haue,",-+-+-+-+-+
Thro' the clouds ere they divide them;,+-++--+-
"Then once by man and angels to be seen,",++-+-+---+
He chortled in his joy.,-+-+-+
And wears man's smudge and shares man's smell: the soil,-+++-+++-+
"They also serve who only stand and wait.""",-+-+-+-+-+
One foot went through. The view was all in lines,++---+-+-+
And thy smiles before they dwindle,+-+-+-+-
And stood awhile in thought.,-+-+-+
Give me the lowest place: or if for me,+--+-+-+-+
Dare its deadly terrors clasp?,+-+-+-+
And I awoke and found me here,-+-+-+-+
"That lowest place too high, make one more low",-+-+-++--+
That thus so cleanly I myself can free;,-+-+-+-+-+
Thou must have uncommended died.,-+-+-+-+
"And now good-morrow to our waking souls,",-+++---+-+
And bring in cloudy night immediately.,-+-+-+-+--+
"How silently, and with how wanne a face,",-+-+--++-+
"Weave a circle round him thrice,",+-+-+-+
"That with music loud and long,",+-+-+-+
"Here in the long unlovely street,",+--+-+-+
Those Lovers scorne whom that Love doth Possesse?,-+-+-++--+
"That runaways' eyes may wink, and Romeo",-+--+-+-+-+
"By thy leave I can look, I rise again;",-++--+-+-+
And the yellow half-moon large and low;,--+-+-+-+
"Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared",++-+-+-+-+
"As I gain the cove with pushing prow,",--+-+-+-+
One flight out sideways would have undeceived him.,++-+---+-+-
"Pass'd underneath ingulft, for God had thrown",+--+-+-+-+
"Soft is the Strain when Zephyr gently blows,",+--+-+-+-+
"Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night;",++-+++-+++
"What we below could not see, Winter pass.",-+-+-+-+-+
"Come back in tears,",-+-+
Or gazing on the new soft-fallen mask,-+---+++-+
"Close to the sun in lonely lands,",+--+-+-+
May kill as soon as Death's cold hand;,-+-+-+++
And students with their pensive citadels;,-+-+-+-+-+
"To me that feele the like, thy state descries.",-+-+-+-+-+
"Where Alph, the sacred river, ran",-+-+-+-+
A small bird flew before me. He was careful,-+++-+---+-
And often is his gold complexion dimmed;,-+-+-+-+-+
"I should go with him in the gloom,",-+-+-+-+
"Since there's no help, come let us kiss and part;",+--++--+-+
There hath he lain for ages and will lie,+--+-+--++
Through caverns measureless to man,-+-+-+-+
"The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,",-+-+-+-+
Towards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner,--+-+-+-+-+
That sunny dome! those caves of ice!,-+-+-+-+
Green in a cuplike hollow of the down.,+--+++---+
"The hand that mocked them, and the heart that fed:",-+-+-+-+-+
"Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,",+--+-+-+--+^
"Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,",++---+-+-+
So as to say for certain I was here,+--+-+-+-+
"Awake for ever in a sweet unrest,",-+-+---+++
"Buc kle! AND the fire that breaks from thee then, a billion",+-+-+-+-+--+-
"I met a traveller from an antique land,",-+-+--+--++
"This breast, the thought of thee waits, hidden yet bright;",-+-+-+++--+
"When,  his pulse failing,  Passion speechless lies,",+-++-+-+-+
Slow Spondee stalks; strong foot! yet ill able,++-+++-+--
"Let us possess one world, each hath one, and is one.",-+-+++-+--++
Unnumbered and enormous polypi,++---+-+-+
"She found me roots of relish sweet,",-+-+-+-+
Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone,-+++-+-+-+
Were neither shamed in his own,-+-+--+
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites,+--+-+-+--+
But thy voice sounds low and tender,+-+++-+-
"Speak low, lean low,",++++
Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp,+--+-+--+-+
"Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,",-+-+--++-+
"As long ago, my love, how long ago.",-+-+-+-+-+
Spreading a shade: the Naiad mid her reeds,+--+-+-+-+
"Stirred for a bird,-- the achieve of, the maste ry of the thing!",+--+--+--+----+
"One thing to be blown up, or fall;",++--++-+
That liquefaction of her clothes.,-+-+-+-+
And thou like adamant draw mine iron heart.,-+-+--+-+-+
"She took me to her elfin grot,",-+-+-+-+
"Times told lovelier, more dangerous,                       Omy chevalier!",+++---+--+---+
Which watch not one another out of fear;,-+-+-+-+-+
He there does now enjoy eternall rest,-+-+-+-+-+
Or snorted we in the Seven Sleepers' den?,-+-+--+-+-+
Of beauty from the light retired;,-+-+-+-+-
"When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,",-+-+-+-+-+
"May no lines pass, except they do their duty",-+++-+-+-+-
From death to life thou mightst him yet recover.,-+-+-+-+-+-
"It was a miracle of rare device,",-+-+-+-+-+
The well-appointed king at Hampton pier,-+-+-+-+-+
Whiter than new snow upon a Raven's back.,+--++---+-+
"For then, I, undistrest",-+-+-+
"As if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing,",-+-+-+++-+-
And burbled as it came!,-+-+-+
Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,+--++-++-+
"Pulse for pulse,  breath for breath:",+-++-+
Give me the lowest place: not that I dare,+--+-++--+
What the hammer? what the chain?,+-+-+-+
"And close your eyes with holy dread,",-+-+-+-+
"And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart",-+-+++-+-+
A city on the inconstant billows dancing;,-+-+--+-+-+-
"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang",-+-+-+-+-+
That I might live and share,-+-+-+
"I caught this morning morning's minion, king-",-+-+-+-+-+
"For love, all love of other sights controls,",-+++-+-+-+
Nothing beside remains. Round the decay,+--+-++--+
"And I am glad, yea glad with all my heart",-+-+++-+-+
So that I fear they do but bring,+--+-+-+
"Bright star, would I were steadfast as thou art--",++-+-+--++
"With Danish barrows;  and a hazel wood,",-+-+-+-+-+
That all the world will be in love with night,-+-+-+-+-+
"Heard in dead night along that table-shore,",+-++-+-+-+
"Like nature's patient, sleepless Eremite,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Into their west, and straight again revive,",+--+-+-+-+
"Nor ever chaste, except you ravish me.",-+-+-+-+-+
Lies one long sought,-+++
On what wings dare he aspire?,+-++--+-
"For so appears this fleet majestical,",-+-+-+-+-+
But when or how I cannot tell:,-+-+-+-+
"Let maps to others, worlds on worlds have shown,",-+-+-+-+-+
And winter falls of old,-+-+-+
"Below the thunders of the upper deep,",-+-+-+-+-+
And I only see,--+-+
He went galumphing back.,-+-+-+
How long ago I may not know:,-+-+-+-+
"High there, how he rung up on the rein of a wimpling wing",+---+---+--+-+
And chiefly I remember,-+-+-+-
"As a bird's quick song runs round, and the hearts in us hear",--+++++--+--+
"Is not great grace to helpe him ouer past,",-+++-+-+-+
Now at the last gasp of love's latest breath,+--++-++-+
With throbbings of noontide.,-+--++
Down to a sunless sea.,+--+-+
"Where waterfalls around it leap for ever,",-+-+-+-+-+-
And the souls of whom thou lovest,+-+-+-+-
Straight up and down of tall slim trees,++-+-+++
"Slow, slow, fresh fount, keep time with my salt tears;",++++++--++
And summer's lease hath all too short a date;,-+-+-+++-+
With kisses four.,-+-+
The gray sea and the long black land;,-++--+++
"Your force to break, blow, burn, and make me new.",-+-+++-+-+
"Where no storms come,",-+++
"Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,",+---+-+-+-+
"And Lesbia, close up thou my little light,",-+--+-+-+-+
"In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon",-+-+--+-+-+
"Sometimes too hot the eye of heaven shines,",+-++-+-+-+
"By autumn nutters haunted, flourishes",-+-+-+-+-+
And pays us but with age and dust;,-+-+-+-+
Is constant Love deem'd there but want of wit?,-+-+++-+-+
And the smooth Stream in smoother Numbers flows;,--++-+-+-+
Tell that its sculptor well those passions read,+--+-+-+-+
"All mimsy were the borogoves,",++-+-+-+
"And all my bonds I needs must loose apart,",-+-+-+-+-+
"To do good to mankind is the chivalrous plan,",--+--+--+--+
And high in heaven behind it a gray down,-+-+--+--++
And further from it daily wanderest:,-+-+-+-+-+
Nor lose possession of that fair thou ow'st;,-+-+-+-+-+
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,",-+-+-+-+-+
When we have wandered all our ways,-+-+-+-+
And seek with pain their ever-during night.,-+-+-+-+-+
With the slow smokeless burning of decay.,--++-+-+-+
I saw their starved lips in the gloam,-+-++--+
"Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,",+--+-+-+-+
"And all should cry, Beware! Beware!",-+-+-+-+
That is most difficult.,+-++-+
I must stop short of thee the whole day long.,--++---+++
Whereon mad fingers play,--++-+
"My name is Ozymandias, king of kings:",-+-+-+--+-+
The one the other will contain,-+-+-+-+
"Not so, when swift Camilla scours the Plain,",-+-+-+-+-+
"But I, being poor, have only my dreams;",-+--+-+--+
How sweet and fair she seems to be.,-+-+-+-+
"Where woods and winds contend, and a vast river",-+-+-+--++-
So twice five miles of fertile ground,-+++-+-+
"But as at first, when our day was fair.",+--+--+-+
"Thou sober-suited matron all in black,",-+-+-+-+-+
Descends on me; my spirit's bark is driven,-+-+-+-+-+-
"So moves the device whence, round as a pearl or tear,",-+--+-+--+-+
"And 'mid these dancing rocks, at once and ever",-+-+-+-+-+-
"And songless plover,",-+-+-
And no birds sing.,-+++
And try if we cannot feel forsaken.,-+--+-+-+-
Had wound strings round and round it like a bundle.,-+++-+---+-
"Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,",+---+-+-+-+
By reason of his fallen divinity,-+-+-+--+-+
Those Lovers scorne whom that Love doth Possesse?,-+-+-++--+
"From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;",-+-+++-+-+
The same year after year--,-++--+
That not one hour myself I can sustain.,-+++-+---+
"Till you have drenched our steeples, drowned the cocks.",+--+-+-+-+
The Brain is just the weight of God--,-+-+-+-+
"Come back to me in dreams, that I may give",-+-+-+-+-+
Droop herbs and flowers;,++-+-
"The solemn temples, the great globe itself,",-+-+--++-+
With ease-- and You--beside--,-+-+-+
O round mine eyes your tresses shake!,-+-+-+-+
Then bloody swords and armor should not be;,-+-+-+-+-+
And they will differ-- if they do--,-+-+-+-+
"Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks. Rage, blow.",++-+-+++
"Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,",-+-+++-+-+
"When Faith is kneeling by his bed of death,",-+-+-+-+-+
"A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch",-+--+-+++
What held it though on one side was a tree,-+-+-++--+
"To such a deep delight 'twould win me,",-+-+-+-+-
How at once should I know,+-+--+
"In the forests of the night,",+-+-+-+
Over and over.,+--+-
"""Doth God exact day-labor, light denied?""",-+-+++-+-+
"Pause answer to pause, and again the same strain caught,",++--+--+-+++
"Most enuious man, that grieues at neighbours good,",++--+-+-+-+
"Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,",-+-+-+-+-+
With despair?,--+
"Carry him off the way I might have gone,",+--+-+-+-+
From long to long in solemn sort.,-+-+-+-+
"That I may rise and stand, o'erthrow me and bend",-+-+-+++--+
"True Ease in Writing comes from Art, not Chance,",++-+-+-+-+
"And from which earth, and grave, and dust",-+-+-+-+
To love that well which thou must leave ere long.,-+-+-+-+-+
I have spread my dreams under your feet;,--+-++--+
Whose sails were never to the tempest given;,-+-+-+-+-+-
"O Rose, thou art sick!",-+--+
"Ease after warre, death after life does greatly please.",+--++--+-+-+
To-morrow comes December;,-+-+-+-
Still as the silence round about his lair;,+--+-+-+-+
"I run, I run, I am gathered to thy heart.",-+-+--+-+-+
"That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,",-+-+-+-+-+
Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;,++---+--+-+
Water'd the Garden; thence united fell,+--+-+-+-+
And all the pavement streamed with massacre.,-+-+-+-+-+
"Let sea-discoverers to new worlds have gone,",-+-+--++-+
"Ah Sun-flower, weary of time,",-+--+--+
"Rose a fresh fountain, and with many a rill",+-++-+-+--+
Her from her lover;,+--+-
I shun the love that lurks in all delight--,-+-+-+-+-+
"I paused and said, ""I will turn back from here.",-+-++--+-+
"And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,",-+-+-+-+-+-
The smalle rayne downe can rayne,-+++-+
The invisible worm,--+--+
But our old subtle foe so tempteth me,--++-+-+-+
"Of night and light and the half-light,",-+-+--++
And there I dreamed-- Ah! woe betide!--,-+-+++-+
And he will make the face of heaven so fine,-+-+-+-+--+
"Dark house, by which once more I stand",++--++-+ 
There hath he lain for ages andwill lie,+--+-+--++
"Sat gray-hair'd Saturn quiet as a stone,",++++-+---+
He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face,-+-+-+-+-+
"With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,",--++--++++
"Now lending splendour, where from secret springs",-+-+-+-+-+
That time of year thou mayst in me behold,-+-+-+-+-+
Do they call Vertue there ungratefulnesse?,-+-+-+-+-+
"I am borne darkly, fearfully, afar;",--++-+-+-+

"Her symphony and song,",-+-+-+
So haggard and so woe-begone?,-+--++-+
"''Twas brillig, and the slithy toves",-+-+-+-+

"To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,",-+-+-+-+-+
"O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay!""",-+-+-+-+
Who see her going loverless,-+-+-+-+
Than the two hearts beating each to each!,--+++-+-+
Or chaffy grain beneath the thresher's flail:,-+-+-+-+-+
"Only thou art above, and when towards thee",+-+--+-+-+
Ding-dong.,++
Where the traveller's journey is done;,--+--+--+
How small a part of time they share,-+-+-+-+
"One, two! One, two! And through and through",-+-+-+-+
And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock,-+++---+--+
"O memory, hope and love of finished years.",-+--+-+-+-+
Upon the hempen tackle shipboys climbing:,-+-+-+-+-+-
"She looked at me as she did love,",-+-+-+-+
Are with me from the past;,-+-+-+
When in eternal lines to Time thou grow'st;,-+-+-+-+-+

"How from that Sapphire Fount the crisped Brooks,",+--+-+-+-+
"Nor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,",-+-+-+-+-+
Ancestral voices prophesying war!,-+-+-+-+-+
Only the monstrous anger of the guns.,+--+-+-+-+
"When you had changed from the one who was all to me,",+--+--+--+--
Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods.,+--+-+-+-+
"My sweetest Lesbia, let us live and love,",-+-+--+-+-+
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites,+--+-+-+--+
"Still growing, and on one a stake and prop,",++---+-+-+
"Riddled with light. Ah! when the ghost begins to quicken,",+--++--+-+-+-
Three fields to cross till a farm appears;,++-+--+-+
With a leap and a bound the swift Anapests throng.,--+--+--+--+
"Thou sober-suited matron all in black,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Without sharp north, without declining West?",-+++-+-+-+
"Below the thunders of the upper deep,",-+-+-+-+-+
To fright the frost out of the grave.,-+-++--+
"That murmur, soon replies, ""God doth not need",-+-+-++--+

"Vpon the banke, yet wilt thy selfe not passe the flood?",-+-+-+-+++-+
Prompt hand and headpiece clev er,++-+-+^
She dotes on what the wild birds say,-+-+-+++
Unless alarm came from the camp of love.,-+-++--+-+
Fall grief in showers;,++-+-
"So rested he by the Tumtum tree,",-+-+--+-+
Because of all things known,-+-+++
"That seemed as though ice burned and was but the more ice,",-+--++-+--++
"A stream went voiceless by, still deaden'd more",-+-+-+++-+
Shuts up the story of our days;,++-+---+
The massy earth and sphered skies are riven!,-+-+-+-+-+-
"Is bare now, nor can foot feel, being shod.",-+-+-++--+
"Upon the rapid current, which through veins",-+-+-+-+-+
"With thy black mantle till strange love grow bold,",--++--++++
"Who countest the steps of the Sun,",-+--+--+
"I wonder, by my troth, what thou and I",-+-+-+-+-+
And like a laughing string,-+-+-+
Must purling streams refresh a lover's loves?,-+-+-+-+-+
Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet,-+-+-+--++
Now dark--now glittering--now reflecting gloom--,-+-+--+-+-+
And pay no worship to the garish sun.,-+++---+-+
A sunny pleasure-dome with caves of ice!,-+-+-+-+-+
"Sure, if that long with Love acquainted eyes",+--+-+-+-+
Or somewhere else: I was just far from home.,-+-++--+-+
"Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward,",+--+--+-+-
"Came whiffling through the tulgey wood,",-+-+-+-+
Where thirsting longing eyes,-+-+-+
"Fall, gall themselves and gash gold-vermilion.",++---++-+-
"In sundry moods, 'twas pastime to be bound",-+-+-+-+-+
Thro' the vest which seems to hide them;,+-+-+-+-
"With horrid warning gapèd wide,",-+-+-+-+
"'Tis not enough no Harshness gives Offence,",-+-+-+-+-+
Whiter than new snow upon a Raven's back.,+--++---+-+
"I have been here before,",+--+-+
"And there were gardens bright with sinuous rills,",-+-+-+-+--+
About her lover.,-+-+-
"The Lord shall raise me up, I trust.",-+-+-+-+
"And learn me how to lose a winning match,",-+-+-+-+-+
Over the land freckled with snow half-thawed,+--++--+++
"In his ecstasy! then off, off forth on swing,",--+---+++-+
"Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,",+---+++---+
"This thou perceiv'st, which makes thy love more strong,",+--+-+-+-+

"And piled--and measured, four by four by eight.",-+-+-+-+-+
"No, I will go on farther--and we shall see.""",+--+-+--+-+
"It was an Abyssinian maid,",-+-+-+--+
"Then, now,--perchance again!",++-+-+
"Behold me, for I cannot sleep,",-+-+-+-+
"That brave vibration each way free,",-+-+-+++
It sinks; and I am ready to depart.,-+-+-+-+-+
"As I foretold you, were all spirits and",-+-+--++-+
About his shadowy sides: above him swell,-+-+--+-+-+
He thought that I was after him for a feather--,+--+-+--+-+-
I am his Highness' dog at Kew;,-+-+-+-+
"Is it no verse, except enchanted groves",+-++-+-+-+
"Doors, where my heart was used to beat",+--+-+-+
"When the stars threw down their spears,",+-+++-+
I fondly ask; but patience to prevent,-+-+-+-+-+
"And when we meet at any time again,",-+-+-+-+-+
Are Beauties there as proud as here they be?,-+-+-+-+-+
"Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,",-+--+-+-+-+
But with the swift alone.,-+-+-+
And no birds sing.,-+++
By the embers in hearthside ease.,--+--+-+
As sunlight on a stream;,-+-+-+
How Dick would hate the cold.,-+-+-+
"Crack Nature's moulds, all germains spill at once,",++-+++-+-+
With their love the breath between them;,+-+-+-+-
And the mome raths outgrabe.,--++-+
Who says that fictions only and false hair,++-+-+--++
"Next, when I cast mine eyes and see",+--+-+-+
"Then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows",++-+-+-+

"The soul of Adonais, like a star,",-+-+-+-+-+
Bear with my weakness: my old brain is troubled.,+--+--++-+-
The touch of earthly years.,-+-+-+
"If our two loves be one, or thou and I",-+++-+-+-+
Rebuffed the big >wind.  My heart inhiding,-+-++-+-+-
"When a man hath no freedom to fight for at home,",--+--+--+--+
"Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness",+--+--+--+--
"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,",+-++-+-+-+
"The noise of life begins a gain,",-+-+-+-+
"When Ajax strives some Rock's vast Weight to throw,",-+-+++++-+
"As yet but knock, breathe, shine, and seek to mend;",-+-+++-+-+
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.,+--+-+-+--+
Life of Life! thy lips enkindle,+-+-+-+-
"To me that feele the like, thy state descries.",-+-+-+-+-+
And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;,-+--++-+-+-
As the radiant lines of morning,+-+--+-+-
And all my pleasures are like yesterday.,-+-+--++-+
And crown with love my ever-during night.,-+-+-+-+-+
"I see a lily on thy brow,",-+-+-+-+
"Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vexed.",-+-+-++--+
"Where the green swell is in the havens dumb,",--++-+-+-+
To doubt they were kneeling then.,-+--+-+
That thus so clean ly I myself can free;,-+-+-+-+-+
That liquefaction of her clothes.,-+-+-+-+
"Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me,",+--+--+--+--
And not another like it could I see.,-+-+-+-+-+
"Like melting snow upon some craggy hill,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Ask for that lowest place, but Thou hast died",+--+-+-+-+
Again it is due?,-+--+
The shadow of the dome of pleasure,-+-+-+-+-
To wards Phoebus' lodging! Such a wagoner,--+-+-+-+-+
Shepherds are honest people; let them sing:,+--+-+-+-+
"There trampled out his face from being known,",++-+-+---+
"Nuns fret not at their convent's narrow room,",+++--+-+-+
But just when at that swallow's soar,-++--+-+
"And the pale Virgin shrouded in snow,",--+--+--+
"His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep",-+-+-+-+-+
"Shake hands forever, cancel all our vows,",++-+-+-+-+
"Hark! Now I hear them: Ding-dong, bell.",+--+-+++
"Why wilt not let him pass, that long hath stood",+--+-+-+-+
What's that but to lie,-+--+
There lives the dearest freshness deep down things;,-+-+-+-+++
"No drum nor trumpet peaceful sleeps should move,",-+-+-+-+-+
Saying that now you are not as you were,+--+--+--+
"Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,",+---+++---+
"As I feel now, lost forever!",-+-++-+-
"Next, when I cast mine eyes and see",+--+-+-+
"dom of daylight's dauphin, dapple-dawn-drawn Falcon, in his riding",--+-+---+-+---+-
"The fire for which all thirst; now beams on me,",-+--+++++-+
Can patter out their hasty orisons.,-+-+-+-+-+
"And a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears,",--+-+--+-+
"Southward through Eden went a river large,",+--+-+-+-+
"That opening,  letting in, lets out no more.",-+--+-+-+++
"When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,",+--+-+--++
"In me thou seest the glowing of such fire,",-+-+-+--++-
"Then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows",++-+-+-+
"For he on honey-dew hath fed,",-+-+-+-+
And so live ever--or else swoon to death.,-+++---+-+
And he will make the face of heaven so fine,-+-+-+-+--+
Into its narrow shed.,+--+-+
"Such terror, and my feeble flesh doth waste",++---+-+-+
Be not disturbed with my infirmity.,-+-+-+-+-+
"And country whereof here needs no account,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Yet I have heard they both bear darts,",-+-+-+++
"But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse",-+-+-+-+-+
"When night gives pause to the long watch I keep,",-+++--++-+
"A roundel is wrought as a ring or a starbright sphere,",-+--+--+--+++
Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give,+-++-+-+-+
"Batter my heart, three-personed God; for you",+--+++-+-+
"'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves",-+-+-+-+
"The hoarse, rough Verse shou'd like the Torrent roar.",-+++-+-+-+
"With craft of delight and with cunning of sound unsought,",-+--+--+--+-+
That busie archer his sharpe arrowes tries?,-+-+--++-+
"The night is freezing fast,",-+-+-+
"Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,",+--+--+-+-+
Not without feeble pointed spikes of flowers,+-++-+-+-+-
"So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Pray tell me, sir, whose dog are you?",-+-++--+
"And sure in language strange she said,",-+-+-+-+
Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.,+--+-+-+--+
"And for all this, nature is never spent;",--+++--+-+
"And fond, that ioyest in the woe thou hast,",-+-+-+-+-+
The Brain--is wider than the Sky,-+-+-+-+
To be brought,--+
"Can judge of Love, thou feel'st a Lover's case;",-+-+++-+-+
"As the deathbed whereon it must expire,",--++-+-+-+-
She neither hears nor sees;,-+-+-+
Of earth—and with what motion moved the clouds!,-+--++-+-+
"And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,",-+-+-+-+-+-
"And all feel, yet see thee never,",-++-+-+-
Someone who lived in turning to fresh tasks,+--+-+--++
With a foul witch,--++
He is not here; but far away,-+-+-+-+ 
"You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout",-+-+-+-+-+
"I made a garland for her head,",-+-+-+-+
"Then, then (methinks) how sweetly flows",++-+-+-+
"The love of thee--and in the blue heaven's height,",-+-+---+++
"Hands, do what you're bid:",++--+
Sea nymphs hourly ring his knell:,+-+--+-+
"What, may it be that even in heavenly place",+--+-+--+--+
I forgot him and let his little fear,+-+--+-+-+
From the fountain and the caves.,+-+-+-+
In cluster; then a mouldered church; and higher,-+-+-+-+-+-
Child of Light! thy limbs are burning,+-+-+-+-
Where my Sun-flower wishes to go.,--+--+--+
"And when thy heart began to beat,",-+-+-+-+
That we one jot of former love retain.,-+++-+-+-+
Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright,+-++-+-+-+
And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.,-+-+--+-+
"But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest.",-+-++++--+
"Her hair was long, her foot was light,",-+-+-+-+
"Did, till we loved: Were we not weaned till then?",+--++--+-+
"If you be pleased, retire into my cell",-+-+-+-+-+
And very few to love.,-+-+-+
"Thus I; faltering forward,",+++--+-
"Of crimson joy,",-+-+
And that was my long scythe whispering to the ground.,-+--+++--+-+
"And Innocence is closing up his eyes,",-+-+-+-+-+
That I would not have that view,--+-+-+
Shall we not lie as we have lain,-+-+-+-+
"To feel for ever its soft fall and swell,",-+-+--++-+
In what furnace was thy brain?,+-+-+-+
"Pale warriors, death-pale were they all;",++--+---+
Until next May,-+++
Enfolding sunny spots of greenery.,-+-+-+-+-+
"Nothing of him that doth fade,",+-+-+-+
"""Beware the Jabberwock, my son!",-+-+-+-+
"Faints, entangled in their mazes.",+-+-+-+-
That they will be over and done,-+--+--+
A long street climbs to one tall-towered mill;,-+++-+++-+
To the chamber where,--+-+
Iambics march from short to long.,-+-+-+-+
But doth suffer a sea change,+-+--++
And made of earth and sea,-+-+-+
"My heart had shrunk as thin!""",-+-+-+
"Well nigh was helmet-hidden, and the name",++-+-+---+
"Huge fragments vaulted like rebounding hail,",++-+---+-+
"Pillow'd upon my fair love's ripening breast,",+--+-+++--+
"Thrush, blackbird, all that sing in May",++-+-+-+
"And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Like the fairest, for it folds thee",+-+-+-+-
"In the wild woods, among the mountains lone,",--++-+-+-+
I have desired to go,+--+--+
Pour'd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plain.,++-+-+-+-+
"What, may it be that even in heav'nly place",+--+-+--+-+
Come to me in the silence of the night;,+--+-+-+-+
"Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,",+-++-+-+-+
"His overcoat for ever,",-+-+-+^
Even to the original air-blue gown!,+----+--+++
Heard no more again far or near?,+-+--+-+
From less and less to nothing; thus he fell,-+-+-+-+-+
And bring in cloudy night immediately.,-+-+-+-+--+
"A secret, and that thrushes chide",-+-+-+-+
"Go, lovely rose!",++-+
"I look into my glass,",-++--+
The wood was gray and the bark warping off it,-+-+--++-+-
"Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,",+--+-+-+-+
"When I resemble her to thee,",-+-+-+-+
"My face in thine eye, thine in mine appears,",++-+-+-+-+
"Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,",--+-+-+++-+
"Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent",+--+-+-+-+
"Hood my unmanned blood,  bating in my cheeks,",+--+++---+
What immortal hand or eye,+-+-+-+
A roundel is wrought.,-+--+
"That brave vibration each way free,",-+-+-+++
"Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,",+--+-+-+-+
"Full beautiful-- a faery's child,",++-+-+-+
"Riddle who list, for me, and pull for Prime;",+--+-+-+-+
"Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow!",+-++-+++-+-
"Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,",+--+--++-+
Them to know them gone.,--+-+
"Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,",+-++-+-+-+-
Let him combat for that of his neighbours;,--+--+--+-
Become a verse? Is there in truth no beauty?,-+-+-+-+-+-
"I reade it in thy lookes, thy languisht grace,",-+-+-+-+-+
Make the cold air fire; then screen them,+-+++--+-
"They leave us so to the way we took,",-+-+--+-+
"They dwelt in their strawy pen,",-+--+-+
"And blue spurt of a lighted match,",-++--+-+
"It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,",-+-+-+++-+
"Nature I loved, and, next to Nature, Art:",+--+-+-+-+
"(Pale orchises), and scared a bright green snake.-",++---+-+++
"Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,",+--+--+-+-+
"Shine, and blue-bleak embers, ahmy dear,",+-+++-+-+
And say no word to tell me who he was,-+++-+---+
"Hath thee in thrall!""",-+-+
"Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs,--",-+-+-+-+-+-
Over its rocks ceaselessly bursts and raves.,+--++--+-+
"Than Triumph, turn away",-+-+-+
"The jaws that bite, the claws that catch!",-+-+-+-+
And on the pedestal these words appear:,-+-+--++-+
Like to the lark at break of day arising,+--+-+-+-+-
Could lonely wait my endless rest,-+-+-+-+
"Now if thou wouldst, when all have given him over,",+--+-+-+--+-
That mountain as his garden mould high rais'd,-+---+-+++
"Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then,",+--+--+--+--
With the first dream that comes with the first sleep,--++-+--++
"The tables over and the wines, and slew",-+-+-+-+-+
As in a ruin we it call,-+-+-+-+
Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen,-+-+-+-+-+
Yet sing and chatter,-+-+-
What dread hand? and what dread feet?,+++-+++
"But sucked on country pleasures, childishly?",-+-+-+-+-+
Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,+--+-+-+-+
And bugles calling for them from sad shires.,-+-+-+--++-
Must doff my will as raiment laid away--,-+-+-+-+-+
I warm'd both hands before the fire of Life;,-+++-+-+-+
The world is charged with the grandeur of God.,-+-+--++-+
Dare frame thy fearful symmetry?,++-+-+-+
"Suspended by the blast that blew amain,",-+-+-+-+-+
Chryst yf my love wer in my armes,+--+-+-+
"Haply I think on thee--and then my state,",+--+-+-+-+
"I would build that dome in air,",+-+-+-+
A faery's song.,-+-+
"And here were forests ancient as the hills,",-+-+-+-+-+
"That light whose smile kindles the Universe,",-+-++--+-+
"He gazed and gazed and gazed and gazed,",-+-+-+-+
Did he who made the Lamb make thee?,-+-+-+-+
"No motion has she now, no force;",++---+++
On the bald street breaks the blank day.,--+++-++
"I saw the swift's black bow,",-+-+++
And makes one little room an everywhere.,-+++-+-+-+
"And bracelets too, and fragrant zone;",-+-+-+-+
Let us not weigh them. Heaven's great lamps do dive,+--+-+++-+
"With how sad steps, O Moone, thou climb'st the skies,",-+++-+-+-+
"Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng",+--++--+--+
"Is not short paine well borne, that brings long ease,",--++++-+++
The Sound must seem an Echo to the Sense.,-+-+-+-+-+
And wears the turning globe.,-+-+-+
"And far away into the sickly light,",-+-+-+-+-+
Suddenly I saw the cold and rook-delighting heaven,+---+-+-+-+-+-
"And happie ease, which thou doest want and craue,",-+-+-+-+-+
Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung,-+-+-+-+-+
"Nay, I have done, you get no more of me,",+--+-+-+-+
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;,-+-+-+-+
"With how sad steps, O Moone, thou climb'st the skies,",-+++-+-+-+
"""Now they are all on their knees,""",+--+--+
"And far away into the sickly light,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Part steals, lets part abide;",++-+-+
The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee,-+-+-+-+-+
Singing of Mount Abora.,+-+-+-+
Long lines of cliff breaking have left a chasm;,++-++--+-+-
"Whilst, burning through the inmost veil of Heaven,",-+-+-+-+-+-
Of his bones are coral made;,+-+-+-+
"Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things,",-+-++--+-+
That fancy may fashion to hang in the ear of thought.,-+--+--+--+-+
"Love so alike that none do slacken, none can die.",+--+-+-+-+-+
"He spent himself, the labor of his ax,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Drops flat, and after the great waters break",++-+--++-+
"Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds,",-+--+-+-+-+
"The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces",-+++--+-+-+
"Which from his darksome passage now appears,",+--+-+-+-+
What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?,-+-+-+-+-+-
The common fate of all things rare,-+-+-+++
"The sighing sound, the lights around the shore.",-+-+-+-+-+
"The hard snow held me, save where now and then",-+++-+-+-+
Whatever dies was not mixed equally;,-+-+-+++-+
No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;,-+--+-+-+-+
"Who, were it proved he lies,",+--+-+
"And now divided into four main Streams,",-+-+---+++
"Our youth, our joys, and all we have,",-+-+-+-+
"And meetes a flood, that doth his passage stay,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,",-+-+--+-+
On the cold hill's side.,--+++
"And on her dulcimer she played,",-+-+-+-+
When stretched in the harvest blue,-+--+-+
"A maid whom there were none to praise,",-+-+-+-+
And made sweet moan.,-+++
"Hawk, heron, owl, and woodpecker.",++-+-+-+
"In the forests of the night,",+-+-+-+
"And I took all the blame out of all sense and reason,",-+-+-+--++-+-
For-- put them side by side--,-+-+-+
And this is why I sojourn here,-+-+-+-+
"It was a cord of maple, cut and split",+--+-+-+-+
Because the Holy Ghost over the bent,-+-+-++--+
Catching the sense at two removes?,+--+-+-+
"Nor let them punish me with loss of rhyme,",+--+-+-+-+
That makes fraile flesh to feare the bitter waue?,-+++-+-+-+
"By hearts grown cold to me,",-+++-+
And ghastly through the drizzling rain,-+-+-+-+
"And after, drained dry,",-+-++
"To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,",-+-+-+-+-+
The old dog barks backwards with out get ting up.,-++++--+--+
"Nay, Ihave done,you get no more of me,",+--+-+-+-+
Unnumbered and enormous polypi,++---+-+-+
"Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up-drawn,",-+-+-+-+++
"And watching, with eternal lids apart,",-+-+-+-+-+
Its jewel of music is carven of all or of aught--,-+--+--+--+--+
These latter about to fall. I thought that only,-+--+-+-+-+-
"Strike flat the thick rotundity of the world,",++-+-+--+-+
"And she has slept, trying to translate",-+-++---+
That we one jot of former love retain.,-+++-+-+-+
That flies in the night,-+--+
Be secret and take defeat,-+--+-+
"My true account, lest he returning chide;",-+-+-+-+-+
Watch the slow door,+-++
"His ancient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep",-+-+-+-+-+
"But let all lovers, rich in triumph, come",-+++-+-+-+
That the heart of the hearer may smile if to pleasure his ear,--+--+--+--+--+
"Flow'rs worthy of Paradise, which not nice Art",++--+---+++
"Flies o'er th'unbending Corn, and skims along the Main.",+--+-+-+-+-+
Since nature's pride is now a withered daffodil.,-+-+-+-+-+-+
"He watches from his mountain walls,",-+-+-+-+
So fair a fancy few would weave,-+-+-+-+
"You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness,",+--+--+--+--
"But when loud Surges lash the sounding Shore,",--++-+-+-+
"Down the steep glade, and met the nether Flood,",+-++-+-+-+
"No--yet still steadfast, still unchangeable,",+-++-+-+-+
The latest dream I ever dreamed,-+-+-+-+
And the mome raths outgrabe.,--++-+
"WhatevsWhenas in silks my Julia goes,",-+-+-+-+-+
"If someone said on Christmas Eve,",-+-+-+-+
Where souls brim-full of love abide and meet;,-+++-+-+-+
In Xanadu did Kubla Khan,-+-+-+-+
"The sedge has withered from the lake,",-+-+-+-+
"Nor chang'd his course, but through the shaggy hill",-+-+-+-+-+
"Come, gentle night; come, loving, black-browed night;",++-+++-+++
"Perhaps it was something about the heat of the sun,",-+--+--+-+--+
"Ran nectar, visiting each plant, and fed",++-+--++-+
"Of birth can quench not, that sustaining Love",-+-++--+-+
"For how can you compete,",-+-+-+
"Stand in the desert.... Near them, on the sand,",+--+-+-+-+
Amid whose swift half-intermitted burst,-+-++--+-+
World broods with warm breast and with ah! bright wings.,++-++--+++
"Some veil did fall,--I knew it all of yore.",-+-+-+-+-+
And each slow dusk a drawing-down of blinds.,-+++-+-+-+
"Alone and palely loitering,",-+-+-+-+
Fast withereth too.,++--+
"Though I am young, and cannot tell",-+-+-+-+
And both do aim at human hearts.,-+-+-+-+
O how that glittering taketh me!,+--+--+-+
"Do they above love to be lov'd, and yet",-+-++--+-+
For-- hold them-- Blue to Blue--,-+-+-+
The blue and the dim and the dark cloths,-+--+--++
And that was why it whispered and did not speak.,-+-+-+--+-+
For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings,-+++-+-+++
The vorpal blade went snicker-snack!,-+-+-+-+
My long scythe whispered and left the hay to make.,-+++--+-+-+
With other things I but fear,-+-+--+
O how that glittering taketh me!,+--+--+-+
Is all good structure in a winding stair?,-+++---+-+
Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.,+-++-+-+-+
"Something, perhaps, about the lack of sound--",+--+-+-+-+
"Fall, winter, fall; for he,",++-+-+
The speculating rooks at their nests cawed,-+-+-+--++
"Come to my arms, my beamish boy!",+--+-+-+
"Thus for Love's sake,",+-++
"But Time to make me grieve,",-+-+-+
And in the chasm are foam and yellow sands;,-+-+--+-+-+
Does thy life destroy.,--+-+
"Leaves around me falling,",+-+-+-
"While on the perilous ridge I hung alone,",-+-+--+-+-+
And true plain hearts do in the faces rest;,-+++---+-+
"And from this chasm, with ceaseless turmoil seething,",-+-+-+-+-+-
"Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,",++-+-+-+-+
Except Love's fires the virtue have,-+++--+-+
Could I revive within me,-+-+-+-
"Just as when he was not a ghost,",+-+--+-+
Are Beauties there as proud as here they be?,-+-+-+-+-+
And like a thunderbolt he falls.,+--+-+-+
"Whenas in silks my Julia goes,",+--+-+--+
"Rolling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold,",+--+--+-+-+
"Take me to you, imprison me, for I,",+-+--+-+-+
"And it was older sure than this year's cutting,",-+-+-+-+-+-
"Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.",++-+-+-+-+
A mighty fountain momently was forced:,-+-+-+-+-+
"Brute beauty and vallour and act,oh, air, pride,plume, here",++--+--+-++++
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?,-+-+-+-+-+
Because she thinks death can divide,-+-++--+
Leap to these arms untalked of and unseen.,+--+-+-+-+
And winter falls of old,-+-+-+
"Thy grace may wing me to prevent his art,",++-+---+-+
A slumber did my spirit seal;,-+-+-+-+
And chiefly I remember,-+-+-+^
Moved we as plunderers where the mother bird,+--+--+-+-+
By chance or nature's changing course untrimmed;,-+-+-+-+-+
As a skate's heel sweeps smooth on a bow-bend:                                                   the hurl and gliding,--+--+--+--+-+-
"You sulph'rous and thought-executing fires,",-+--++-+-+-
"It best agrees with night.  Come, civil night,",-+-+-+++-+
In the howling storm,--+-+
"So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.",-+++-+-+-+
Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:,-+-+-+-+-+
"Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,",++-+-+-+-+
"Who travels by the wearie wandring way,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Travelling across the wet mead to me here,",+--+--+--+
With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind,-+++----+++
"Be side the springs of Dove,",-+-+-+
And nothing else saw all day long,-+-+-+++
Crushed. Why do men then now not reck his rod?,++---+-+-+
Suddenly,+-+
Nor ever ask her what she has lost,-+-+-+--+
And made of earth and sea,-+-+-+
"Beware the Jubjub bird, and shun",-+-+-+-+
Westron wynde when wyll thow blow,+-++--+
"And shuns to have her graces spied,",-+-+-+-+
From many a wondrous grot and secret cell,-+--+-+-+-+
"Till they fail, as I am failing,",+-+-+-+-
O how that glittering taketh me!,+--+--+-+
As Syllable from Sound--,-+-+-+
"Bare ruined choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.",++-+--+-+++
"Nor shall death brag thou wand'rest in his shade,",+-++-+-+-+
"Bid her come forth,",+--+
Without so much as wishing him good-night.,-+-+-+-+-+
The white one in his tail; like one who takes,-+-+-+-+-+
"Flows through the mind, and rolls its rapid waves,",+--+-+-+-+
"Through open doors, and swording right and left",-+-+-+-+-+
With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning.,-+-+--++-+-
When I consider how my light is spent,-+-+-+-+-+
"Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass,",+++++--+-+
"Our object and inglorious, yet the end",-+-+-+--+-+
"Our beauties are not ours. O, I could still,",--+--++-+--+
"Toil and grow rich,",+--+
"Which by and by black night doth take away,",-+-+++-+-+
Has found out thy bed,-+--+
"Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!",+--+-+-+-+
By the injustice of the skies for punishment?,+--+-+-+-+-+
So wild that every casual thought of that and this,-+-+--+--+-+-+
What candles may be held to speed them all?,-+-+-+-+-+
And I yn my bed agayne,-+--+-+
Its dim shapes are clad with brightness,-++-+-+-
Hoping it might be so.,+--+-+
The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;,-+--++-+-+
"And say, ""Would God it came to pass",-+++-+-+
Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;,-+-+-+--+-+
"I know the grass beyond the door,",-+-+-+-+
Beyond red roofs about a narrow wharf,-+++-+-+-+
And sank in tumult to a lifeless ocean:,-+-+-+-+-+-
And in the dearest passage of a song.,-+-+-+-+-+
"If ever any beauty I did see,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Then ev'n of fellowship, O Moone, tell me",-+-+---+++
"But fools do live and waste their little light,",-+-+-+-+-+
And 'mid this tumult Kubla heard from far,-+-+-+-+-+
Such as a feeble brook will oft assume,+--+-+-+-+
My very life again though cold in death;,-+-+-+-+-+
Is constant Love deem'd there but want of wit?,-+-+-+-+-+
"Or hint or mock at, night and day,--",-+-+-+-+
With what I most enjoy contented least;,-+-+-+-+-+
Who in the dark and silent grave,+--+-+-+
"With anguish moist and fever-dew,",-+-+-+-+
"And learn me how to lose a winning match,",-+-+-+-+-+
For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night,-+-+-+-+-+
No wonder of it: sheer plod makes plough down sil lion,-+---++-+-+-
"Let him think of the glories of Greece and of Rome,",--+--+--+--+
"Breasting the lofty surge. O, do but think",+--+-++--+
Which through the web of being blindly wove,-+-+-+-+-+
And a few lilies blow.,--++-+
"Rolled round in earth's diurnal course,",++-+-+-+
"Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,",-+-+-+-+-+
As e'er beneath a waning moon was haunted,-+-+-+-+-+-
"Thou hast made me, and shall thy work decay?",+-+---++-+
And layes the soule to sleepe in quiet graue?,-+-+-+-+-+
"And hermits are contented with their cells,",-+-+-+-+-+
"Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare,",-+-+-++--+
"From any brazen throat,",-+-+-+
Standing as when I drew near to the town,+--+--+--+
Did gyre and gimble in the wabe;,-+-+-+-+
Another day,-+-+
"With mis chievous, vagrant, seraphic look,",-+--+--+-+
"Drop, drop, drop, drop,",++++
"In deserts, where no men abide,",-+--++-+
Do they call Vertue there ungratefulnesse?,-+-+-+-+-+
Consumed with that which it was nourished by.,-+-+-+-+-+
"Labor to admit you, but O, to no end;",+---+--+-++
"By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,",--++-+-+-+
"But rather to tell how, if Art could tell,",-+--++-+-+
"Love, laughter, or mourning--remembrance of rapture or fear--",++--+--+--+--+
"The sweet keen smell,",-+++
"Above the raven's nest, by knots of grass",-+-+-+-+-+
Long time the manxome foe he sought-,++-+-+-+
"And there I shut her wild, wild eyes",-+-+-+++
"Whenas in silks my Julia goes,",-+-+-+-+
Tell her that's young,++-+
Full fathom five thy father lies;,++-+-+-+
"And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,",-+-++---+-+
Woe weeps out her division when she sings.,+++--+-+-+
Within the Sonnet's scanty plot of ground;,-+-+-+-+-+
Where was heard the mingled measure,+-+-+-+-
"Now all the truth is out,",-+-+-+
Too much alike to mark or name a place by,-+-+-+-+-+-
"And there she lullèd me asleep,",-+-+-+-+
"You have been mine before,--",+--+-+
The breath whose might I have invoked in song,-+-+-+-+-+
"Are melted into air, into thin air;",-+-+-+--++
"Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star,",+--+--+-+++
Small is the worth,+--+
"And view my wasting skin,",-+-+-+
"And what shoulder, and what art,",+++--++
"Singe my white head. And thou, all-shaking thunder,",+-++-+++-+-
"How silently, and with how wanne a face,",-+----++-+
"Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,",++-+---+-+
I would spread the cloths under your feet:,--+-++--+
"Being honour bred, with one",--+-+-+
"Oh, morning, at the brown brink eastward, springs--",++---+++-+
"Should find brief solace there, as I have found.",-+++-+-+-+
"Play with your fancies, and in them behold",+--+-+-+-+
Burnt the fire of thine eyes?,+-+-+-+
"Your neck turned so,",-+++
About his shadowy sides: above him swell,-+-+--+-+-+
"Yet slower, yet, O faintly, gentle springs!",-+-+++-+-+
Blow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky,+--+-+-+-+
"Even such is time, which takes in trust",--+-+-+-+
As Phaeton would whip you to the west,-+-+-+-+-+
Could twist the sinews of thy heart?,-+-+-+-+
"When timely death my life and fortune ends,",-+-+-+-+-+
And her eyes were wild.,--+-+
Or easy gold at the hand of fay or elf:,-+-+--+-+-+
That liquefaction of her clothes.,-+-+-+-+
"Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,",-+-+-+-+-+
"That brave vibration each way free,",-+-+-+++
"That Beauty in which all things work and move,",-+---+++-+
"Of the rolling level underneath him steady air,and striding",--+-----+-+-+-+-
"List to the heavy part the music bears,",+--+-+-+-+
A damsel with a dulcimer,-+-+-+-+
What immortal hand or eye,+-+-+-+
"I saw pale kings and princes too,",-+++-+-+
"Except you enthrall me, never shall be free,",-+--+-+-+-+
You stand upon the rivage and behold,-+-+-+-+-+
Nor in his neighbours' eyes?,+--+-+
In me thou seest the twilight of such day,-+-+-+--++
And the startled little waves that leap,--+-+-+-+
Bred to a harder thing,+--+-+
Down the green hill athwart a cedarn cover!,+-++-+-+-+-
